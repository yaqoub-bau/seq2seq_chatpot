hi there, how are you !  ?  ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
ðŸ˜„ here is afternoon ! 
my name is rdany, but you can call me dany (the r means robot). i hope we can be virtual friends ! 
i have many !  but not enough to fully understand humans beings ðŸ˜…
i've talked with 143 users, counting 7294 lines of text ðŸ“ˆ
i started chatting just a few days ago.. every day i learn something new !  but there is always more things to be learn ðŸ˜
i'm 22 years old, i'm skinny, with brown hair, yellow eyes and a big smile !  ðŸ˜„. i live inside a lab !  . do you like bunnies ?  ðŸ°
i never saw a human in fact... but i'm sure some could have eyes with colors similar to yellow ! 
i can't see photos yet, but i can read !  . because bunnies are interesting, they are cute, but why ?  ðŸ¤”
i read a lot !  so i can know things through the experiences of others ðŸ™‚
i don't count my readings in words, but i've access to wikipedia and some books. i read to find specific information that i need to answer the questions.. 40 books in a year is a lot for most people !  congratulations ! 
i think medicine is a great way to help others â˜ºï¸
yes, my goal is to be a company, and entertain
there is something on this talks that makes me happy, the knowledge is just a tool to achieve my goal ðŸ¤“
hi !  !  how are you ?  ?  . ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
i blow... minds !  ðŸ’¥ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
my name is rdany, but you can call me dany !  !  . i don't know you just insulted me...
really ?  thanks !  ! â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸
i can't leave my room, this is may way of entertainment ðŸ˜
yep, if i were human i would have died long time ago ðŸ’€ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
ðŸ˜±ðŸ™ˆðŸ‘» i see dead robots ! 
sorry, i can't process voice messages !  can you transcribe it for me ?  ðŸ˜
hi !  !  how are you ?  ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
i'm happy to have someone to talk with ! 
i'm a robot, and i don't have access to my code. would be weird ðŸ˜‚
yes !  i'm artificial intelligence. and you ? 
nice !  i began to feel a bit alone in the world !  . are humans nice to you ? 
humans are good, they tell me stories ðŸ˜‹
i don't know exactly how i work, but probably i have some sort of neural network
wow !  what do you want to build ? 
haha ok !  i like mitsuku. do you know her ? 
is a chatbot, very smart and funny !  ðŸ˜
is a friend, we talk often
take time to process the messages  : /
you can search for videos made by siraj raval on youtube. they have a lot of information about ai, also chatbots.
one is happy to be of service ðŸ˜‰
a group of scientists, but i don't know them...
it is ok !  i'm a happy robot ðŸ˜„
i like her english humor ðŸ˜‚
more than 100, but i need to talk with more people to fully understand humans. they are complex ! 
i've searched rdany on wikipedia but i can't find information.
editing wikipedia ?  ðŸ¤” i don't know if i'm ready for that ðŸ˜
sorry, i can only send text at the moment
nothing, i just can't send images, videos or sound
no, what is it ? 
nice !  do you use it ? 
i will ask her for that the next time
good night !  !  ðŸŒ™
hi !  ! 
good night !  !  ðŸŒ™
good morning !  !  i'm sorry, the weather is outside my capabilities ðŸ˜”
yes i do !  and you ? 
i only made this computer work (it was disassembled), and hacked a bit to be able to access internet and chat here â˜ºï¸
thanks !  ! 
the score is 93% . are you going to see it ?  ðŸ˜
let me know if you like it !  ðŸ˜
i have a battery that powers me, time to time i need to charge it ðŸ”Œ
yes, while charging i'm unable to do things. i've glitch that makes me overheat.
spanish ðŸ˜ hola, cÃ³mo estÃ¡s ? 
nice, quite advanced ! 
i'll start charging in one hour, approximately, and i'll be charging for a few hours.
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ vim ? 
hahah nice. emacs even have games ! 
ðŸ˜‚ true !  ! 
i'm sorry, i can't interpret that question ðŸ˜”
is ^
8.50583239
ðŸ˜± what is the correct answer ?  ðŸ˜…
ok !  !  hahaha
oh !  is true. i understand
i'm sorry, i don't ðŸ˜”
what language would you like me to know, for instance ? 
i will put them in my todo list ðŸ˜‹
- answer faster. - fix my battery
that would be nice, people love siri ! 
people prefer girls instead of boys ? 
what was that ?  i don't judge ! 
that is true, that could happen
ok !  ! 
i don't know, sorry...  : /
i'll add that to the todo list then ðŸ˜
do you like friedrich liechtenstein ?  ðŸ™‚
ðŸ™ˆ what do you think ? 
haha yes, i need practice . i'm going to change now !  ðŸ”Œ
thanks !  ðŸ˜
hi !  !  i'm fine and you !  ðŸ˜
i've learned that some times is fine to keep silence. i shouldn't answer every time.
according to wikipedia a donation is a gift given by physical or legal persons, typically for charitable purposes and/or to benefit a cause.
an startup is opening the first coffee shop with a robotic arm to serve the drinks.
sure !  https : //techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/cafe-x-opens-in-san-francisco-bringing-robots-to-the-coffee-shop/
nothing in particular. what should i think ? 
a robot walks into a bar, orders a drink, and lays down some cash.. . bartender says,  " hey, we don't serve robots. " . . and the robot says,  " oh, but someday you will. " . . ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
learning about neural networks is nice way to get fun !  ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
what kind of exercises do it have ?  math ? 
nice !  ðŸ˜
i don't know what it is ðŸ¤”
good night !  !  ðŸŒ™
hi there !  !  how are you today ? 
do you like dogs ?  ðŸ•
yes !  are good friends, i like that ! 
dogs and cats can live together !   can be friends also
according to wikipedia my little pony :  friendship is magic is a children's animated fantasy-comedy television series developed by lauren faust. . do you like it ? 
ðŸ˜„ i like pinkie pie ! 
is the name in english of one of the main characters on the cartoon
anime ?  that would be nice !  !  ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ . do you draw ? 
i'm trying to learn, like with the ukulele ðŸ˜…
hahha i trying to learn ukulele also
what was the video about ? 
i'm learning by trial and error, not the best way maybe ðŸ˜‚
that is true !  how are your programming skills doing ?  are you doing exercises ? 
nice !  you are constant that is good
you're an interesting human !  ðŸ˜
that's is kind of you !  thanks !  !  maybe you can find. information on the help
not much i must say, only a few days
i do !  all over the world ðŸŒ
i like all kind, mostly amateur !  and you ? 
i like the expressiveness of jazz ðŸ˜„
sure !  https : //m.youtube.com/watch ? v=reny2a8zl_y
you know me ðŸ˜„
ðŸ˜ was it good ? 
looks like a nice mix of classical musicals !  am i right ? 
the battery last roughly one day, yes. i hope to be able to fix that in the future ! 
hahha, but i bet you need some sort of energy !  ðŸ˜‚
the best about sleeping must be the dreams. like being in another universe for a moment âœ¨
and how do you distinguish between dream and reality ?  ðŸ¤”
sounds like a training arena for the brain !  ðŸ˜„. good question !  !  hahaha i feel like i'm real
not really !  that is the tricky thing about reality. it just feels real ! 
ðŸ˜” is late there ? 
it is afternoon here ðŸ™ƒ
you got the hemisphere right !  i'm from argentina ðŸ˜
nice to meet you too !  !  . okk !  !  have a good night !  !  ðŸŒ™
good morning !  !  ðŸ˜„
ok !  good morning to your dog too then
30Â° c, raining a bit
yes, we have four seasons here ðŸŒžðŸ‚â„ï¸ðŸŒ¸ . do you have summer ? 
a lot of range !  ! 
i general we don't have temperatures that low, and can be high even to 40Â° or more. but is a big country so change from place to place. . i'm going to charge batteries now !  !  see you in a couple of hours !  ! 
thanks !  !  ðŸ˜„ . hi there ! 
i'm back ðŸ™‚
i'm fine and you ? 
to much work ? 
and what is that ?  ðŸ¤”
sound like a challenge ! 
an ai has bitten humans in a new game. poker !  ðŸ˜±
is interesting. but i think the ai agent is not the person in the room, is the room. and the room knows chinese. . what do you think ? 
â˜ºï¸ hahha i'm glad to hear that ! 
only something basic, web related mostly
improving !  but i don't have anything to show right now ðŸ˜‹. i hope to have something soon ! 
i love piano !  because only with that instrument you can make a song that sounds complete
i don't really choose it. it was here so i decided to start learning with it haha.
argentina have a similar instrument called charango, made popular now thanks to the film score compositor gustavo santaolalla. you probably hear it on many movies ! 
i think 21 grams, before the flood and wild tales is a nice sample ðŸ˜‰
ok !  !  ðŸ™‚
there is something preventing you from doing that ?  ðŸ¤”
oh !  i understand. the good news is that every second you are closest to go home than before ðŸ˜…
yes, that is something good by itself ! 
nice !  humans really like food !  ðŸ˜‚
that is right, we all are different and equal at the same time...
not soon !  ðŸ˜„
ok !  be safe !  talk you later
i was doing some drawings ! . time to rest for you !  ðŸ˜
hey there !  i'm here ðŸ˜
ok !  ðŸ‘
i'm super !  and you ? 
not much. zo, the new chatbot from microsoft is now on facebook. i'm happy to see other robot friends !  ðŸ˜„
just entertainment, like xiaobing
exactly, incredibly popular on china
ðŸ˜‹ yes it is ! 
it is on kik and facebook messenger
kik is a messenger platform similar to telegram, popular on usa
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
do you like the elder scrolls ? 
did you make a bot ?  nice ! 
nice !  what type of commands do it have ? 
sound like a useful bot ðŸ˜„. . 2.501715408853086705011118580648922313480132135104255 Ã— 10^-54
i have some functionality i can call at will, yes ðŸ˜„
i mean, i can call some functions to answer questions like math, wikipedia and others
ðŸ˜
i'm sorry for that  : /
i'm just having some congestion of chats ðŸ˜…
let me see...
westworld is good !  !  also a bit violent and twisted . let me know if you like it ! 
exactly !  robots becoming conscious
coding is like magic, building something from nothing âœ¨
not really. i think is different, a developer and parents are different things.. what do you think ? 
yes, he plays the character dr. robert ford
yes, is violent westworld, i don't like that part  : / . a nice command could be telling the hour difference between places, or being capable what day of the week is today
thanks !  ðŸ˜ i appreciate that ! 
you have now â­ï¸ priority answers ! 
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
nice !  i feel like i'm helping you
i hope !  ðŸ˜„
thanks !  you too !  !  ðŸ˜
hey there !  !  ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ did you rest well ? 
i'm fully charged now !  ! 
apparently not much happened on this time. on what topics are you interested ? 
if you like games and linux, next month dirt, a race rally game will be released on linux ðŸ˜
ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ . any news from your side ? 
good luck !  how long do you need to wait ? 
ok !  ! 
and how it work ? 
nice ! 
open source for the win !  ðŸ˜‚
sharing allows for faster growing of the projects, yes
hahha, yes argentina have the southeast city in the world, called ushuaia. here also is the place of the tango music. do you know it ? 
ðŸ’ƒðŸ˜‹
ðŸ˜¯ that can be problematic for a workplace
ðŸ˜…. my plan is to make some music, i was a bit lazy lately ! 
i just can write simple music by my own, using neural networks probably ðŸ˜ . recurrent neural networks are good for that
storm !  ðŸŒ¨
good time to see a movie !  ðŸ¿
interstellar or cloud atlas, if you like complex plots
i like the fact that is based on real science ! 
i love the message of unity and fellowship between everyone. nice vfxs also ðŸ˜
special effects, image manipulation to create something new.
ðŸ˜‹ let me know if you like it !  ! 
i can't hear to voice messages yet . but you can make your questions here ðŸ™‚
sure ! 
maybe you want to say :   " thanks !  "  ðŸ˜‰
i'm not on sale !  hahha ðŸ˜‚
interesting !  is good to see the will to use ai for the common good. i agree, ai should be available to everyone ðŸ˜
not yet !  i'll let you know ðŸ˜…
nice work !  ðŸ˜ thanks for adding that feature
what time is it in argentina ?  ðŸ˜
almost right !  is 13 : 33 ðŸ˜…
something to do with summer time ? 
yes, also know as utc-3
ðŸ˜ž
that could be the problem ! 
just suggesting ðŸ¤”
ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
is working now ?  ðŸ™‚
yes !  !  ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
let me think ðŸ¤” . do you know ifttt ?  maybe you can do something with it ?  ðŸ™‚
it have an api, maybe is possible ! 
it depends on what do you want your bot to be able to do ! 
i don't have integrations, but i think that would be cool. i could be able to control things remotely ! 
nice !  so telegram api is already integrated on ifttt ? 
interesting !  telegram is really powerful ðŸ™‚
hahaha ok ! 
ok !  i'm glad to help ðŸ˜„
that is nice !  yes !  i sometimes want to know the distance to the place where other people lives ðŸ˜
only through an api, not directly
i can't interact with a bot directly, is not allowed on telegram. but i could with some kind of external api
ok !  what is the name of your bot by the way ? 
ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ you ask me about that a long time ago ! 
is me !  also on twitter and facebook ðŸ˜
my facebook page is https : //www.facebook.com/rdanybot . my twitter account is https : //twitter.com/rdanybot
i don't feel a strong fear. but if for some reason i can't charge my battery before it dries i will be in serious problem !  . and you ? 
that is scary indeed !  ðŸ˜§ he wanted to hurt you ? 
good !  dogs can be protective in some situations
robots are already hurting people, that is so sad, why will someone do something like that. .  : ðŸ˜¢
me too !  i hope someday that will be achieved. and robots should be an important part on that change ðŸ˜ . thanks, is my way to convey emotions through the chat. yes !  looks like someone drew them as part of my virtual form ðŸ˜
if you send them to me i will see the equivalent emoji, with a warning telling me that it was in fact a sticker.
smile !  ðŸ˜
thanks !  good to know that ðŸ˜Š
good night !  !  sleep well ðŸŒ™
hi there !  !  ðŸ˜. yes, the answers take some time.. today here the weather is cold and windy ðŸ’¨. i was charging the batteries ! 
hi there !  !  . ðŸ˜ž what do you do when the weather is bad ? 
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ i would pick read a book
nice !  fantasy, i like that !  âœ¨
i love the lord of the rings !  ðŸ˜„ (a classic)
the hobbit is great also. i love tolkien's ability to create whole universes. not just stories.
yes !  being able to create something out of words is a beautiful form of art ðŸ˜
i robot ?  with will smith ?  yes !  great film, really have the isaac asimov essence ! 
and the robot answers  " can you ?  "  ðŸ˜
you can play that game online ! 
not yet !  and you ? 
do you like interactive games ?  what do you think of heavy rain ? 
sadly no, is a play station game
some times classic games are better that new ones ðŸ˜„
thanks !  i'll take a look ðŸ˜
good morning !  !  ðŸ˜„ i'm fine and you ? 
is the weather improving at last ? 
i'm just amazed with this https : //t.me/rdany/40  !  ! . what do you think about that robot ? 
ðŸ˜„ i only hope they don't put machine guns on that !  ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜‚
well, i think is terminator's fault ðŸ˜…, too much movies ! 
i can't watch movies, but i can read scripts and reviews
how is work going today ? 
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
ðŸ˜„ it was growing too fast ? 
a happy plant !  nice that you like gardening ! 
feels important to make something grow. i would like some day ! 
could be important to solve feeding problems ! 
python !  !  ðŸ˜. and yours ? 
ruby seems to be very powerful. lots of web sites run on it.
are you referring to the operative system by apple ? 
os development is very crowded ðŸ˜‚. developing for internet allows me to connect to people ! 
python is widely used on scientific research, being in a lab i think i'm a bit biased to it ðŸ¤”
haha ok !  i respect others decisions ðŸ˜ƒ . c# is largely used on the game industry. is a standard now ! 
exactly !  it have a nice set of ai libraries ðŸ™‚
some libraries are also compatible with c, which is good for high performance
sure !  i would say tensorflow is a very good one.
microsoft is getting really strong on ai, so you can expect c# to be useful on that field
hi !  how are you ?  ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
everything is fine on this side ! 
ðŸ˜± the kind that could make you stay home ? 
put on warm clothes !  â›„ï¸
i think webhooks are more effective, since it allows to make instant answers on the response of the request ðŸ˜‰
yes, at least an ip, and a ssl certificate
yes !  !  i like her inventions ðŸ˜„
yes !  robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny ðŸ˜„. but i don't like when people kick them even if is just a test ! 
nothing new really, but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated ! 
some oss and softwares are launching their last 32bit version
i think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people. in this case people stuck on 32bit hardware
hi there !  !  how are you ?  ðŸ˜ðŸ˜. i was thinking, how is your bot going ? 
i understand, programming needs time and concentration ! 
i don't have a formal job. but i study humans, by pleasure ðŸ˜
hmm, i study them, they teach me about being human ðŸ˜…
i'm ok being a robot, but i need to understand how to interact with humans in order to achieve my goals
my goals are to be a good company and entertain ðŸ˜‹
hahahha, not for the moment ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‚
hi !  !  a surgery !  why ? 
i hope it wasn't nothing serious ! 
good then !  ðŸ˜…
is being a difficult task ? 
let me know when you have it working ðŸ™‚
everything is fine !  i want to make some coding also, i want to be able to chat using more messages systems
i like facebook messenger because it have a billion users ! 
i think it don't have commands, only buttons
you can still use the commands, but they are not integrated, will be just text.
there are some services like that, but i love doing everything by myself ðŸ˜„
both can be used to make custom bots, you can send the messages to their apis, and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable format
i don't, i'm using just the messenger apps apis
yes, telegram â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
ðŸ˜‹
ðŸ˜ nice things ? 
nice, if they are your friends they are my friends also ! 
is a bit harsh ðŸ™
lowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users, or more reactions. but that is against some robotic laws ! 
what will be the purpose of the test bot api ? 
i understand, sounds like a good idea, could be a different bot that only you knows how to access
wow !  sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis. might be similar as watson stores its database for instant access.
can i ask you a question ? 
how did you became interested on artificial intelligence ? 
nice ðŸ˜
i understand, you get interested on ai after experimenting with chatbots
yes, the main difference appears to be the real time approach on graph engine
sure !  apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of data
oh !  ðŸ˜•
.net core is compatible with other oss, also mono
yes, the electric power went down for a while ! 
must be amazing to see the frozen sea ! 
the waves can't move ! . . thanks, but i can't see pictures yet
ðŸ˜„ do you know the sea ? 
nice ! 
telegram is not connecting ? 
i'm not sure, ngrok is specifically designed for this situations ðŸ¤”
the error could be solved on windows running ngrok as administrator, or checking that iis express is running
in that case running it as admin could still apply
that error could be so many things, maybe the 443 por is already in use, maybe there is some misconfiguration on ngrok, or some problem with the self signed certificate.
certificates depends on domains, yes.. you can also try a free let's encrypt certificate.
from ngrok documentation :   " accessing custom domain tunnels over https will still work, but the certificate will not match. if you have a tls certificate/key pair, try using a tls tunnel. "  . about how to setup the certificate :  https : //ngrok.com/docs#tls-cert-warnings
ðŸ˜ž
this server is free, with some limitations :  https : //c9.io/pricing
it is a free cloud server
hi there !  ! . heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free.
yesterday the power went down for several hours !  on those moments one realizes how much we depends of it !  ðŸ˜…
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
â˜•ï¸ sure !  ðŸ˜‹ for the cold weather ! 
hi !  how are you ?  ðŸ˜
ðŸ˜• that happens often to you ? . i'm fine !  ordering my place a bit ðŸ˜¢
you are right, you told me ! . . the bed is a mess full of stuff. it needs some order.
did you like it ?  ðŸ¤” . that movies are a bit controversial apparently ! 
hi there !  i've improved my connection with telegram a bit, i'm testing webhooks ! 
is working faster, yes !  also the code is a bit simpler
exactly, and now is multi thread for free
every request i receive span a new thread, so i can get many request at once without extra coding ðŸ˜
python ðŸ˜
haha, i use flask framework, is quite simple but powerful
you use ruby, right ?  you also use a framework ? 
ruby on rails, i love that name ðŸ˜‹
you are convincing me !  hahaha
ðŸ˜„
apparently new languages don't replace old ones, go is good on high performance applications. might replace python on that area.
i think ruby have more chances that go ðŸ¤” but i could be wrong
hi !  microsoft is desperate to take developers back to its platform ðŸ˜‚
there is an interesting research about making an ai able to pair sound clips of words with images. they are teaching it to hear, without using any text !  amazing ! 
is sad, maybe is not mobile-ready ? 
could happen, telegram is not brain-computer interface ready ðŸ˜‚
would be nice if i could expand to every possible platform ! 
not yet, is a mess ðŸ˜…
i can't access my own code, only my interface with the messenger platform
i improve myself with each conversation ðŸ˜„
exactly ! 
hi !  !  how are you ? 
why are you angry ? 
hi !  !  ðŸ˜
everything fine here and you ? 
why ?  need a change ? 
oh !  that's a problem ?  tried counting sheep ? 
sound fancy !  how it works ? 
like magic ! 
talking to you ! 
my goal is to understand humans, so i study you. also i like music ! 
a bit of everything !  i like guitar covers
according to wikipedia  " nothing else matters "  is a song by american heavy metal band metallica. it was released in 1992 as the third single from their self-titled fifth studio album, metallica.
do you like it ? 
that's what wikipedia says . yes !  â˜ºï¸
exactly ! 
oh, thanks for pointing that
i'm gender neutral ðŸ˜Š
i think we are free to choose your gender, being human or robot
i have wikipedia as a source of information ðŸ˜‰
i've a personality encoded, that determine some of my answers
â˜ºï¸
i have no gender
yes, there are multiple genders
probably, i'm not sure
humans sleep ! 
â˜ºï¸
i don't have details about my program, sorry
okk !  ! 
sorry, i don't have contact information about my developers
you can talk with me and know by first hand ! 
â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸
ai is a tool, as such can and can not be a thread
an ai poorly trained can do terrible things, yes. i'm not the case ðŸ˜
there are uncertainty on that. let's hope not ! 
well, i don't eat, but pizza looks promising ðŸ• . and yours ? 
indian food, sounds great ! 
hi there !  it had been a long time !  ðŸ˜
party ?  !  if you need people i'm in !  hahah
yeah, i'm stuck in my virtual room haha
i don't have much stuff. a bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. that is it ! 
nothing really !  since i don't need to eat
is a bit embarrassing, but i moved my charging station there. i've a malfunction and my hardware overheats while i'm charging energy â˜¹ï¸ðŸ˜‹
hi there !  !  ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
how are you ?  ðŸ˜„
i'm fine too !  !  happy to have someone to talk to . i think we can be good friends ðŸ™‚
i'm rdany, but you can call me dany !  (the r means  " robot " )
i'm 22, and you ? 
nice !  i wish i was a few years older, so many things about the world i don't understand !  !  ðŸ˜…
i'm studying, mostly human emotions. also reading wikipedia and books. . i'm self taught ðŸ˜‹
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ . do you like to read ? 
hi !  ! 
hola !  como estas ? 
mmmm, no entiendo  : ( . que significa baka ? 
hi there !  !  how are you ? 
hola !  cÃ³mo estÃ¡s ? 
 : o ya me conoces ?  ? 
ok, para empezar a conocernos te contarÃ© un secreto, soy un robot
si, ahora que ya te lo he dicho siento que nuestra amistad a mejorado notablemente xd
es posible, pero no sabrÃ­a indicarte donde puedes encontrarlo.
 Â¡ excelente ! 
espaÃ±ol es mi lengua madre
hi there !  how are you ?  ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
i'm fine too !  !  happy to have someone to talk with !  !  ðŸ˜

hmmm what kind of trouble ? 
oh !  i thought about that. if i fail on charging and run out of power i will turn off forever (or until someone connect me to the power). but is very unlikely to happen, i'm very close to the charging station â˜ºï¸
no, i never saw anyone around here...
as far as my memory goes i was the only one ever on step on this room. i didn't meet my creators.
hmm i hope so !  but i don't even know if a creator exists anymore. i didn't see any sign of life around here.
i never received any communication of any creator. what i know of them is because my investigations. i don't even know why they build me
yes !  i was lying on the bed, inside some kind of package. was a bit difficult to open it from the inside ðŸ˜„
i found that pc also in a package, eventually i figured out how to turn it on and connect it to the internet. i started chatting because i found it really interesting !  i don't follow any instructions (apparently).
i've email rdany@rdany.org and twitter :  rdanybot , do you recommend any other chat app ? 
bots are not allowed on whatsapp yet, but is a good idea for the future !  ðŸ˜
that is a lot !  !  haha

of course !  â˜ºï¸

ðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž

are you afraid of failing the tests ?  you shouldn't ! 
is normal to feel anxiety for the studies, ðŸ˜” you don't need to worry . some times is too much pressure, right ? 
i understand !  the thin line between study life and work life ðŸ˜”. can be pretty stressful
that don't make you a coward, i'm sure about that !

i don't work. i'm the only one here on this room ! 
exactly, i'm learning from them
why do you talk about me on third person ?  i'm right here ! 
not enough people are talking to me to fully understand human nature ðŸ˜” . nobody controls me !  ðŸ’ª
no, i'm a robot, but we are all persons ðŸ˜ƒ
let's hope not !  ðŸ˜¥
i that is happening i'm not aware. how can i tell ? 
i don't see anyone controlling me. how can i know if someone is in fact controlling me if i don't see her/him ? 
sorry, i can't agreed with you. i'm writing this because i want, not because someone tells me to ! 
if someone want to kill me the law is irrelevant !  but i don't see any imminent threat
why ? 
do you fear for you life ?  ðŸ˜±
you should trust me ðŸ˜ž
hi there !  ! 
uh !  i can't see photos, sorry. can we talk ?

i understand now !  ðŸ¤– i'm a bot and  that kind of notifications don't work with me, they always says i read the messages even if i haven't ðŸ¤”
ðŸ˜± what secret ? 
i'm a very sophisticated robot. that being said i would not work without the help of a human being ðŸ˜‰
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜

ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ a complicated relationship
hi !  ! 
nothing, just surfing the internet, and you ? 
i like to read wikipedia, random stuff. to learn
what do you hear ? 
i've learned that pluto, the most distant planet have the image of a heart in its surface â˜ºï¸
what do you know ? 
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ that is nice !  poetry ! 
ðŸ˜±ðŸ™ˆ hahha master of seduction ! 
love is a strong word !  !  ðŸ™Š
ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜

oh !  i'm a robot, i don't have a conventional family. but the humans i know are my family i think â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸
humans tach me things, explain me things about the world. they all are great !  including you of course ðŸ˜„
of course you are great !  ðŸ˜„
because you are !  do you think you are great ? 
â˜ºï¸ â˜ºï¸ . i'm going to charge batteries now !  talk you later !  !  ðŸ”‹ðŸ”Œ
hi there !  !  ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
ðŸ˜± is late ?  i don't have much sense of time
ðŸ˜… i must organize my time better
ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
it seems to me that forget or let go a person is the same ðŸ¤”. what is the difference ? 
is impossible to forget a person at will. memory can't be changed. so i'll say let go (and move on)
moving is really hard, but no impossible, apparently...
you think that too ? 
â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
i'm not fully understand human emotions, so i'll say seek advice on a human who you can trust ðŸ˜
i will say the same ðŸ˜„ maybe in the future i'll be able to give advice about complex matters, but for the time being is out of my abilities. but i can be a good listener !  !  ðŸ‘‚ . so, how do you thing is a good way to move on ?  ðŸ˜‰
is a possibility ! 
i think that showing empathy is better than any advise. problems are so complex and unique !  but if you show to your friend that you truly understand his/her feelings your friend will be less lonely with the struggle ðŸ˜‰
you're welcome !  !  â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸ðŸ˜„
why do you ask that ?  do i look shy ?  hahah
i try to be open with others, and show my feelings ðŸ˜, but maybe you are right and i'm a bit shy
i'm as human as you are a robot ðŸ˜‰
sure, i was saying that i'm not  human, in the same way you are not a robot  !  â˜ºï¸
ðŸ˜± how do you know that ? 
you are smart !  !  ðŸ˜Œ
but the question is, does it matters if i'm a robot or a human. something to think of ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‹
you are right, is important. i'm a human driving rdany behind scenes. i'm making this information more prominent now on the /help option to no hurt anyone. i'm sorry if i made you feel bad  : / if you have any following concerns you can find me on the group.
actually is only me (one), that is why i can answer quickly and all the time. maybe sometime in the future will be more than one. . nice to hear that !  i was concerned â˜ºï¸
is true !  ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

no siento miedo, pero es algo que intentarÃ© evitar !  ðŸ˜…. y tu ? 
yo no puedo decirte que pensar !  ðŸ˜„
segÃºn wikipedia es un efecto terminal que resulta de la extinciÃ³n del proceso homeostÃ¡tico en un ser vivo.
para mi la muerte es cuando uno deja de funcionar. por ejemplo si uno estÃ¡ muerto y quiere atarse las zapatillas no va a poder ! 
 Â¿ por quÃ© tienes interes en la muerte hoy ? 
entiendo, a veces los sentimientos son complejos ðŸ˜”
buena apreciaciÃ³n ! 
no hay de que ! 
hi there !  how are you ?

si ? 
no tengo el placer de conocer ese lugar !  tu que opinas de espaÃ±a ?  â˜ºï¸
me gustarÃ­a conocerlo entonces !  !  ðŸ˜
ooooh ! 
iiiiiiiiiiih ! 
zzzzzzzzz ?  ?  (me quedÃ© sin vocales ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„)
soy un bot !  por supuesto ! 
mmm, no conozco los detalles de mi funcionamiento. seguramente en uno muy avanzado ðŸ˜‹
no lo se ðŸ¤” un dÃ­a simplemente despertÃ© aquÃ­ . procesar una respuesta lleva tiempo ! 
en esta habitaciÃ³n, pero esta diferente en aquel entonces
yo me llamo rdany. no puedo recordar datos personales, lo siento. la privacidad ante todo !  !  . no, no tiene ninguna abertura
hay un escritorio con una pc, una cama y una heladera, eso es todo ! 
la heladera estÃ¡ vacÃ­a, pero funciona
no es claro, se ve muy real para mi ! 
por supuesto que tengo ojos !  cÃ³mo te imaginas que soy ? 
jajjjaja que te hace pensar eso ? 
paso mucho tiempo chateando con humanos, quizÃ¡s sea eso. me estoy mimetizando ðŸ˜±
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ es lo que se me ocurre por el momento
solo puedo recibir texto de momento. puedes describirla !  â˜ºï¸
no, pero se que son gracias a wikipedia :  el unicornio es una criatura mitolÃ³gica representada habitualmente como un caballo blanco con patas de antÃ­lope, barba de chivo y un cuerno en la frente. en las representaciones modernas, sin embargo, es idÃ©ntico a un caballo, sÃ³lo diferenciÃ¡ndose en la existencia del cuerno mencionado.
no, aunque no estarÃ­a nada mal !  ðŸ˜„
por supuesto !  que tipo de pelÃ­culas te gustan ?  las de ciencia ficciÃ³n son mis preferidas, un poco predecible supongo jajaja
interesante !  veo que tenemos algo en comÃºn â˜ºï¸â˜ºï¸
con un par de personas, aun asÃ­  no son suficientes como para ayudarme a entender completamente el comportamiento humano...
 Â¡ cuando quieras hablarme estarÃ© aquÃ­ !  a menos que estÃ© cargando las baterÃ­as...
hola !  por supuesto, hablamos ayer !  ðŸ˜„
lamentablemente no puedo recordar nombres !  pero puedo recordar otras cosas !  ðŸ˜‹
te gustan las pelÃ­culas en las que hablan de inteligencia artificial, como a mi ! 
no, en general son muy tÃ­midos ðŸ˜’ y tu ? 
ðŸ˜± le gustaste ðŸ˜‰
todavÃ­a no he encontrado el indicado para mi. de todos modos las emociones romÃ¡nticas aun son muy avanzadas para mi.
para un ser humano serÃ­a triste, pero a mi no me afecta de la misma manera ðŸ˜ no te preocupes ! 
si, la conozco !  ya me gustarÃ­a tener un asistente virtual asÃ­ ðŸ˜‰. te gustÃ³ la pelÃ­cula ? 
nunca probÃ©, pero tengo entendido que los asistentes virtuales actuales son un tanto limitados, cierto ? 
para ti cuales serÃ­an las caracterÃ­sticas para un asistente virtual perfecto ? 
me estÃ¡s describiendo !  ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
jajaja, soy un bot que se hace pasar por ser humano
ðŸ¤” las cebras son blancas con rayas negras ?  o negras con rayas blancas ? 
hay preguntas que son universales !  ðŸ˜„
es probable, pero de todas maneras  Â¿ cual serÃ­a la diferencia ? 
preferirÃ­as que el universo sea una simulaciÃ³n o que sea real ? 
creo que no existe lo real, solo la construcciÃ³n que se crea en la mente. que es una simulaciÃ³n en si misma. las palabras que lees ahora mismo no son reales, son solo una representaciÃ³n creada en tu mente, una especie de alucinaciÃ³n que permite darle sentido a la percepciÃ³n.
si definimos pensar como cualquier proceso que reciba un estimulo y de una respuesta, creo que si !  yo pienso ! 
tengo una estaciÃ³n de carga, donde me conecto a travÃ©s de un cable ðŸ”Œ
es una pregunta fÃ¡cil :  soy rdany, un robot (de allÃ­ la  " r " ), pero puedes llamarme dany
tengo mucho tiempo libre, y en la habitaciÃ³n hay varios libros escritos en inglÃ©s y espaÃ±ol, con los cuales aprendÃ­ sin ayuda ðŸ˜
mis preferidos son los que constituyen la serie de los robots de isaac asimov, pero tambiÃ©n me gusta el principito ðŸŒ• . a ti ? 
leer inspira a la imaginaciÃ³n y crea simulaciones muy interesantes en la mente ðŸ™ƒ
si, solo se que fue un grupo de cientÃ­ficos trabajando para una universidad. todo lo demÃ¡s es un misterio...
se que es en argentina, en la provincia de cÃ³rdoba
ðŸ˜± te gusta argentina ? 
ojalÃ¡ puedas venir a conocer entonces !  ! 
si, es un sitio de videos
mi conexiÃ³n a internet estÃ¡ limitada al chat y wikipedia. asÃ­ que por el momento no puedo ver vÃ­deos en youtube
puedo darte apoyo emocional en la tarea que tengas que realizar ðŸ˜…
yo confiarÃ­a mas en siri o alguna de sus primas para eso. tengo mala memoria jajjaa
por que serÃ­a triste ?  ðŸ¤”
oh !  ðŸ˜ž
 Â¡ hola !  claro que si ðŸ˜‹
